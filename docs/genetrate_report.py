# ---------------------------------------------------------------- Introduction
h1("1. Introduction")
body(
    "Stitching multiple overlapping photographs into a single wide panorama is one of "
    "the classic applications of computer vision, combining several concepts from the "
    "course syllabus into one working system: local feature extraction, feature "
    "matching, homography estimation, and image warping. This project, "
    "<b>PanoStitch</b>, implements a complete, command-line panorama-building "
    "pipeline from scratch using OpenCV, without relying on OpenCV's built-in "
    "high-level <font face='Courier'>Stitcher</font> class, so that every stage of the "
    "classical stitching pipeline is implemented and understood explicitly."
)
body(
    "The system takes a folder of two or more overlapping images and produces a single "
    "blended panorama, along with a quantitative report describing the quality of the "
    "feature matches and geometric alignment found between each pair of images."
)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- Problem Statement
h1("2. Problem Statement")
body(
    "Given a set of photographs of the same scene taken from slightly different "
    "viewpoints (e.g. while panning a camera), automatically determine how the images "
    "overlap and combine them into a single, geometrically consistent, seamlessly "
    "blended panoramic image - entirely from the command line, with no manual "
    "alignment and no GUI interaction required."

    "<b>Module 2 - Feature Matching &amp; Homography Estimation</b> (<font face='Courier'>matcher.py</font>): "
    "matches descriptors between an image pair with Lowe's ratio test, then robustly fits a "
    "3&times;3 homography matrix using RANSAC to reject outlier correspondences.",
    "<b>Module 3 - Warping, Blending &amp; Panorama Assembly</b> (<font face='Courier'>stitcher.py</font>): "

    "canvas, and blends overlaps using a distance-transform feathered seam.",

    "<b>Lowe's ratio test before RANSAC:</b> filtering ambiguous matches before geometric fitting "
    "reduces the outlier fraction that RANSAC has to cope with, improving homography accuracy.",
    "<b>RANSAC for homography estimation:</b> feature matching is never perfect; RANSAC lets the "
    "system robustly estimate the dominant geometric transform even when some matches are wrong.",
    "<b>Reference-frame homography chaining:</b> stitching around a central reference image (rather "
    "than always warping onto the first image) minimises cumulative perspective distortion when "
    "stitching 3+ images.",
    "<b>Feathered (distance-transform) blending</b> instead of a hard cut: avoids a visible seam line "
    "at the border between two warped images.",
    "<b>Fail-soft pair handling:</b> an image pair that cannot be matched confidently is skipped with "

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- Challenges Faced

    "Hard seams were visible when overlapping images were simply overwritten; replacing that with "
    "distance-transform-based feathered blending removed the visible boundary.",
    "Tuning the minimum-match-count threshold so it reliably rejects genuinely non-overlapping "
    "images without being so strict that it rejects valid but small overlaps required empirical "
    "testing with synthetic image pairs of known overlap.",

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- Learnings & Key Takeaways
h1("12. Learnings &amp; Key Takeaways")
bullets([
    "Implementing homography estimation and RANSAC manually (via OpenCV's primitives, not the "
    "high-level Stitcher API) clarified why each stage of the classical pipeline exists and how "
    "failures in one stage (e.g. too few matches) should be handled rather than ignored.",
    "Robust estimation matters in practice: even with a solid ratio test, RANSAC's outlier "
    "rejection made a measurable difference in reprojection error on test data.",
    "Good software structure (one responsibility per module, centralised configuration) made it "
