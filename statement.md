# Project Statement: Panorama-Stitcher

## Problem Statement

Creating high-quality panoramic images from multiple overlapping photographs is a non-trivial task. Manual composition in image editing software is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires significant user expertise. Users capture sequences of overlapping photos (e.g., landscape sweeps, architectural documentation, wide-angle scenes) but lack automated tools that reliably register and composite them into seamless panoramas.

**Core Challenge**: Algorithmically detect corresponding features across images, establish geometric relationships (homography), reject outliers, and blend images to produce a single coherent panoramic output—all without manual alignment or GUI interaction.

**Real-World Context**:
- Photographers need automated panorama creation to handle high-volume photo sets
- Computer vision applications (drone imagery, medical imaging, 3D reconstruction) require robust image alignment
- Mobile and embedded systems demand CPU-efficient algorithms (SIFT vs. ORB trade-offs)

## Scope of the Project

### In Scope

1. **Multi-image registration**: Automatically detect and match keypoints across 2 or more overlapping images
2. **Homography estimation**: Compute geometric transformation matrices using RANSAC to robustly estimate alignment
3. **Sequential stitching**: Register images in order (left-to-right or front-to-back) without user intervention
4. **Image blending**: Composite aligned images into a single panoramic output
5. **Modular architecture**: Separate concerns (detection, matching, stitching, I/O) for testability and reuse
6. **CLI interface**: Command-line entry point with configurable parameters (detector, thresholds, logging)
7. **Comprehensive testing**: Unit tests and integration tests for each module
8. **Logging & metrics**: Detailed per-pair statistics (keypoints, matches, inliers, errors) for debugging and validation
9. **Performance optimization**: Automatic image downscaling to balance speed vs. quality

### Out of Scope

- **Interactive GUI**: No graphical user interface for manual adjustment or preview
- **Real-time video stitching**: No continuous frame processing from live camera feeds
- **Advanced projections**: No cylindrical, spherical, or fisheye models (affine homography only)
- **AI-based refinement**: No deep learning for learned feature descriptors or semantic alignment
- **Multi-band seam finding**: No sophisticated gradient-domain blending or seam optimization
- **Batch processing framework**: No worker pools or distributed stitching across multiple machines

## Target Users

### Primary Users

1. **Photographers & Content Creators**: Professionals who shoot panoramic sequences and need rapid, hands-off compositing
2. **Computer Vision Practitioners**: Students and researchers implementing classical stitching pipelines as reference implementations
3. **Automation Engineers**: Teams integrating image processing into headless/CI/CD pipelines where GUI tools are impractical

### Secondary Users

- Educators teaching feature detection, geometric transformations, and RANSAC
- GIS & remote sensing analysts compositing aerial or satellite image mosaics
- Developers building mobile or embedded vision applications who need an open-source baseline

### Output Artifacts

1. **Panorama Image**: `output/panorama.jpg` (or custom path) — final stitched photograph
2. **Metrics JSON**: `output/metrics.json` — per-pair statistics for validation & debugging
3. **Summary Text**: `output/summary.txt` — human-readable report of stitching process
